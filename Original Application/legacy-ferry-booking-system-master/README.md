# Legacy Ferry Booking System

This is a simple console application that pretends to be a rudimentary ferry booking application.
It was originally written for a series of legacy code workshops and should provide plenty of material for refactoring exercises.

## Suggested Exercise: The Saff Squeeze.

There's a bug within this code base, the time table that is printed is missing a ferry name in the first time table slot. The expected correct timetable can be found in the `java/src/main/resources/` folder and in the `C-Sharp/FerryLegacy/Data/` folder.

Can you use the Saff Squeeze technique to zone in on the offending line of code causing this error? (The bug is slightly contrived, but most people that have done this workshop with me have found it)
